    "text": "Hypotheses\n\nHypothesis 1 (Brooke):\nFrom a factor analysis of several variables in the Spotify data, three factors emerged that describe the various components of the songs. It is hypothesized that both the intensity and involvement factors will predict song popularity such that the higher the factor score, the more likely the the song will have a higher popularity score (over and above the effects of the other factor scores). The third factor, technicality, will not significantly predict song popularity.\nsong_popularity = b0 + b1_intensity + b2_involvement + b3_technicality [all predictors are continuous]\n\n\nHypothesis 2 (Sarah):\nI hypothesize that song length will predict track type (song or not) but will not predict whether a song is both live and acoustic. For the relationship between track length and track type, I expect that longer tracks are less likely to be a song. I hypothesize that covariates (tempo, loudness, genre) would not affect the outcome.\np(song) = b0 + b1_length (+ b2_tempo + b3_loudness + b4_genre) (where genre is categorical, song is binary, and the rest of the variables in the model are continuous)\np(liv_acoust) = b0 + b1_length (+ b2_tempo + b3_loudness + b4_genre) (where genre is categorical, liv_acoust is binary, and the rest of the variables in the model are continuous)"
